# Shipping Containers

_Shipping Containers_ is an experimental art album
exploring copyright in the guise of filk hymns.

The premise is a lonely space traveler thinks about what might
be in store for the colony ship when they get there, but due to
copyright restrictions only music made before 1923 is available
on-board. So, he combines the two.

Filk music is frequently composed of songs about a particular
fandom set to established music. In this case, each song is
about a particular science fiction or fantasy fandom. (With
one song combining two different space-related fandoms.)
The tunes of these songs are explicitly public domain hymns.
Most of these songs use a single hymn tune per song, but a few
combine multiple hymn tunes in to a more structure containing
chorus, verse, and bridge components. 

## Special Note for Educators

The Creative Commons Attribution license means you can use
this material as you like, _including covering the entire
album and selling the results to benefit your school._
While some of the songs had arrangements tweaked slightly to
better fit the lyrics, they are all traditional hymn tunes,
and this means it should be possible to listen to other
interpretations of the tunes to get ideas for what you can
do with this sort of thing.

_We want to help you use our music._ While it may use traditional
tunes, the lyrics may well be interesting enough for even
modern young people.

This book was written using Lilypond, and the source files
are organized to make it easy to extend and modify. For instance,
while this book includes a single vocal staff and a standard
piano staff, for recording we used fakebooks with just the
vocals so we could easily see the melody and lyrics without
the visual clutter of piano staffs.

What sort of specialized format would be most beneficial to you?
SATB with two staffs and the lyrics in the middle? Separate books
for soprano, alto, tenor and bass? Shifting a voice to another
pitch? This is easy to do, we simply need to know what you need.
